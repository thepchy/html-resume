# 🌟 Capstone Project 1: HTML Resume
Welcome to my very first capstone project as I begin my journey into the world of tech! 👩🏻‍💻✨

💼 My first online resume built with basic HTML. Part of my Capstone Project 1, showcasing my career shift into tech and my journey as a future developer.

This project is a personal online resume built entirely with basic HTML. As a former content writer and customer service team lead, I’m now learning to code with the goal of becoming a future-ready developer. This resume reflects not only my work history—but also my curiosity, adaptability, and drive to grow in the tech world.

## 🔧 What I’ve used
- HTML5 (semantic elements, links, lists, images, headings, voids)
- A dash of creativity 🧠
- A whole lot of learning and love ❤️

## 📌 What you'll see
- Career Summary
- Work Experience
- Tech Skills
- A preview of mini projects I've built during learning

## 🚀 What’s next?
This is only the beginning! I’m currently learning CSS and Git, and will be styling and upgrading this resume soon. Stay tuned! 🌈
